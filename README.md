# Model UN Debate Software
This program is a model United Nations software used to track debate, including speaker’s list, voting procedure, caucuses, taking role, etc. and is based on the parliamentary procedure used at the Southeastern High School Model United Nations (SHSMUN) conference in Chattanooga, TN. It was created using Python and the Tkinter GUI library. The software was tested by the multiple model UN chairs and used at SHSMUN with over 300 delegates. 

The project followed a set of success criteria:
1.	Countries present in committee can be inputted in application.
2.	Program can take roll and update roll with new voting status or new countries.
3.	Program can generate a text file with countries and voting status from roll.
4.	A custom timer can be used, paused, and reset.
5.	Program can generate .wav recordings of speaker when timer is running.
6.	Speaker’s list and the current topic/speaker can be displayed.
7.	Possible motions at different stages of debate can be displayed.
8.	Program can enter voting procedures with specified voting type, voting style, and majority requirement.
9.	Based on the roll, countries listed as present and voting do not have option to abstain during voting procedures and countries listed as absent do not vote.
10.	In a roll call vote, countries can be recorded as with or without rights. 
11.	Warning will appear if error occurs.
